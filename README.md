# Developers-salary-in-egypt-2024
Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world data collected from software developers in Egypt.
The goal is to understand how factors like job role, work type, experience level, and location impact average salaries.
It is especially designed to help students and junior developers make more informed career decisions using real data.

 Objectives
Compare salaries by job type (e.g., backend, low-code, AI)
Examine the impact of work type (full-time vs. part-time)
Explore how location (urban vs. developing areas) affects pay
Test if experience levels significantly influence salaries

Key Challenges
Data Imbalance: Most entries were full-time roles, which could bias results
Small Sample Sizes in some groups (e.g., part-time, low-code)
Inconsistent City Names required cleaning and categorization

Solutions & Techniques
Used random sampling to balance full-time and part-time data
Standardized job roles and grouped them by category
Converted inconsistent city names into defined regions
Applied statistical tests like t-test, ANOVA, and correlation analysis

 Key Insights
Low-code developers had the highest average salaries, despite being few
Backend developers were the most common, but had lower average salaries
Urban regions (like Cairo) tended to pay more than developing cities
No significant salary difference between full-time and part-time roles
